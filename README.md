ðŸ§  Project Summary
This project analyzes employee messages to assess sentiment and engagement using natural language processing (NLP), statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. It includes sentiment labeling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), monthly scoring, employee ranking, flight risk detection, and regression modeling to forecast sentiment trends. The goal is to support HR decision-making with data-driven insights.
